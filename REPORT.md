# ðŸš€ Today's Project Progress Recap ðŸš€

Today, I made significant strides in developing both the backend and frontend of my project. Here's a quick overview of what I accomplished:

## Backend Development

### 1. Project Structure:

I organized my project with a clear structure, including directories for api, frontend, and essential configuration files. The main components are:  

```bash
.
â”œâ”€â”€ .venv/
â”œâ”€â”€ api/
â”œâ”€â”€ db.sqlite3
â”œâ”€â”€ frontend/
â”œâ”€â”€ manage.py
â”œâ”€â”€ mysite/
â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.txt
â””â”€â”€ TODO.txt
```
### 2. API Implementation:

- Views: Created StudentListCreate and StudentRetrieveUpdateDestroy views to handle CRUD operations for student records.
- Models: Defined a Student model with fields for name, roll number, and major. Implemented choices for majors and a __str__ method for better readability.
- Serializers: Developed a StudentSerializer to convert model instances to JSON and vice versa.
- Testing: Wrote comprehensive tests for the API using Django's test framework to ensure that all CRUD operations work as expected.

## Frontend Development

### 1. React Application:

- Structure: Set up the frontend with a structured file hierarchy under src, including components for managing and displaying student data.

Copy code
```bash
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ AddStudent.js
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ StudentList.js
â”œâ”€â”€ App.css
â”œâ”€â”€ App.js
â””â”€â”€ index.js
``` 

- AddStudent Component: Implemented a form to add new students to the backend API. Included state management and error handling for form submissions.
- StudentList Component: Developed a component to fetch and display the list of students. Handled loading and error states gracefully.
- App Integration: Integrated both components into the main App.js, providing a seamless user experience for adding and viewing students.

## Summary
Today was all about connecting the dots between backend and frontend. I set up a robust backend API with Django and crafted a responsive React frontend to interact with it. The API now supports full CRUD functionality for student records, and the frontend provides a user-friendly interface to manage these records.

Looking forward to testing further and refining the application. Stay tuned for more updates!
